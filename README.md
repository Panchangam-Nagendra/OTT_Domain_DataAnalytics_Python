Project Title: OTT Domain Data Analytics

Description:
Analyzed and visualized a dataset from the over-the-top (OTT) streaming domain to derive actionable insights into content trends, user behavior and platform performance. The project leverages Python (data-wrangling, exploratory analysis), Jupyter Notebooks, and visualization libraries to showcase findings.

Key Objectives:

To clean, preprocess and explore an OTT streaming dataset (including metadata such as title, genre, release year, country, and possibly ratings/views).

To extract meaningful insights such as which genres dominate, how release year correlates with popularity, regional differences in content, and temporal trends in titles added.

To create effective visualisations (bar charts, heatmaps, trend lines) so stakeholders can easily interpret the insights.

To demonstrate end-to-end data-analysis skills: data ingestion → cleaning → EDA → visualization → summarizing key business-questions.

What I Did / My Role:

Imported raw dataset into a Notebook and performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand structure, missing values, outliers, and basic distributions.

Cleaned and preprocessed the data: handled missing values, converted data‐types (e.g., dates), dealt with duplicate entries, standardized categorical values (genres, countries).

Performed deeper analyses, for example:

Frequency of content by genre and by country

Distribution of release years and any shift in trend over time

Relationship between type of title (movie vs show) and other variables

Possibly mapped content additions by year to user viewership or ratings (if available)

Created rich visualisations to highlight key findings: e.g., bar charts for top genres, heatmaps for genre vs country, time-series plots for content additions.

Summarised the business implications: e.g., “If genre X is rising in country Y, the OTT platform should prioritise content acquisitions / production in that genre for that market.”

Tools & Technologies:

Python (libraries such as pandas, NumPy for data manipulation)

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Possibly markdown cells in Notebook to document findings and insights

Why this project is relevant:

Shows ability to work with real-world data, perform cleaning and exploratory analysis — a key part of a data analyst role.

Demonstrates capability to draw business-relevant insights from data, not just technical manipulation.

Matches your stated goal of being a fresher data analyst: you’re showing you can complete a full analytics workflow end-to-end.

The domain (OTT streaming) is current and relevant in the media/tech industry — helps your portfolio stand out.
